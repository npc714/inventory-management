# Inventory Management / Point of Sale App

A full-stack inventory management and point of sale (POS) system with real-time updates using **Vue 3 (Vite)** for the frontend, **Node.js + Express** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for the database.

This is my **second fullstack project**, so some features (like staff/inventory update or delete) weren't implemented.
